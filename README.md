# Information about the CyVerse Discovery Environment (DE)

The [Discovery Environment](https://cyverse.org/discovery-environment) (DE), a key product of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure, provides a modern web workbench for powerful computing, data, and analysis app resources for your scientific analyses.

By providing a consistent user interface for access to the tools and computing resources needed for specialized scientific analyses, the Discovery Environment facilitates data exploration and scientific discovery. For more information about the features in the Discovery Environment, see more information in the [CyVerse Learning Center](https://cyverse-learning-materials.github.io/cyverse_mooc/step3/#self-guided-discovery-environment-tour)

The completely open-source code powering the DE and its backend can be found at https://github.com/cyverse-de/

If you are looking to extend and customize DE for your own project the use of the underlying REST based Terrain API for DE is recommended, check the [introductory webinar](https://cyverse.org/webinar-webapplication) [customized analysis portals](https://cyverse.org/webinar-webapplication) and [documentation](https://de.cyverse.org/terrain/docs/index.html)
